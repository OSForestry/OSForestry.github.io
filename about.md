### The dream that is OS Forestry

Open Source Forestry, or OS Forestry for short, is an idea. An idea that the field forestry should be as open and free as the forest itself; freely sharing knowledge, tools, and ideas to the benefit of all involved in forestry. OS Forestry is in its infancy, but together we can make it a reality.
